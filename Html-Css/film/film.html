	<strong><em><h2>EXCLUSIVE:</h2></em></strong>
	<strong><em><p><h3>Sony Pictures</h3>
	looks to be getting more serious about mounting another installment of Zombieland. Studio just hired Dave Callaham to write the sequel under the supervision of Ruben Fleischer, who’ll return to direct. Gavin Polone is producing. Callaham’s script Barrow became The Expendables, and his recent credits include Legendary’s revival of Godzilla, and most recently Jackpot, a Focus Features film based on a story by Swedish crime writer Jo Nesbo that has Will Gluck producing. It was that darkly comic tale that sparked Sony to hire him for the Zombieland sequel. Callaham also did a production rewrite on Marvel’s Ant-Man. Insiders at the studio said no deal with Fleischer, but that of corpse they are getting serious about mounting the sequel of a 2009 cult favorite sleeper film that grossed $100 million worldwide. Not sure if the participants will be back; pretty much all of them have soared since making the original, from Jesse Eisenberg to Emma Stone, True Detective’s Woody Harrelson, Abigail Breslin (who plays the title zombie in the upcoming Maggie), and Bill Murray, who’s upcoming in St. Vincent. Latter wasn’t properly positioned for a return and if he wouldn’t do another Ghostbusters, a reprise here couldn’t be as cool as it was the first go around. UTA and Kaplan/Perrone rep Callaham along with attorneys Gretchen Rush and Dan Fox..</p></em></strong>
